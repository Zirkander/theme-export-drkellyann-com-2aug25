<p> My Bone Broth Diet revolutionized the world of healthy, protein-rich home cuisine. Now, my Bone Broth on-the-go packets make it even easier to get the essential nutrients you need to nourish and repair your whole body — without the cooking or prepping.</p>
<p>I want your journey toward a healthier lifestyle to be on YOUR terms. I want you to look and feel your best whenever and wherever you want. And my anytime/anywhere single-servings of collagen-rich bone broth are the easiest (and tastiest) way to get there.</p>
<h2>Anytime, Anywhere Bone Broth</h2>
<p>Directions: Pour contents into bowl and add 8-12 oz. of boiling water. Stir until blended. Add your favorite spices for added flavor.</p>
<h3><b>How Do We Make Our Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making bone broth is the same for both liquid and powdered forms — except for the final step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is made by simmering animal bones, connective tissues, and cartilage with a combination of apple cider vinegar, savory herbs, and spices in a slow cooker. Bovine bones and tissues are used for beef bone broth, while whole chicken feet, beaks, bones, and tissues are used to make chicken bone broth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are then simmered on a stovetop for a total cook time of over six hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the slow-cooking process is complete, the broth becomes a gelatinous and nutrient-rich superfood. To make our best-selling bone broth powder, this “liquid gold” is then dehydrated into a powder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Kellyann only uses the bones of hormone-free, grass-fed bovine that hail from Germany and Brazil to make her hydrolyzed collagen powder. Dr. Kellyann’s hydrolyzed collagen is packed full of amino acids that are easy for the body to absorb. These amino acids can help support collagen and protein production in the body. </span></p>
<h3><b>How Can Bone Broth Benefit Your Health?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may know of bone broth as a safe and effective tool to help with weight loss, but there are many other benefits of bone broth, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Dr. Kellyann’s Classic Chicken Bone Broth has 16 grams of added protein in each serving. That protein can help fuel your body and keep you feeling fuller for longer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also contains zero sugars, fats, or cholesterol and is also low in calories, carbohydrates, and saturated fat. This means it pairs perfectly with many weight loss programs and diets, including keto and paleo diets.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 15 to 16 grams of hydrolyzed collagen contained in each Classic Chicken Bone Broth packet can help smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as minimize the effects of sagging skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bodies naturally produce collagen, but as we age, collagen production can slow down. Eating foods that contain collagen and collagen-supporting amino acids is a great way to begin supporting your natural collagen production and skin elasticity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is also rich in vitamins and minerals like calcium, potassium, magnesium, and collagen, thanks to the marrow bones used in bone broth recipes. This nutritious blend of minerals can help support gut health, weight loss, skin health, and overall wellness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amino acids, like glutamine and glycine, can help support your gut microbiome. They may also help support new cell growth, the health of your gut lining, and overall digestion by helping to break down fats more thoroughly. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Recipes Can You Cook With Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is a versatile blank canvas for a myriad of recipes. While we love drinking bone broth on its own, it’s also a wonderful base for gluten-free stew and soup recipes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our favorite ways to incorporate bone broth into a weeknight meal is by combining it with fresh veggies to make a hearty pho. Simply combine some veggies into a large pot or a crock pot, along with our bone broth, peppercorns, sea salt, bay leaves, and aromatic herbs, and cook on high heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in some freshly cooked chicken and some rice noodles, and there you have it! This easy recipe is a great way to use bone broth without adding unnecessary prep time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have some leftover bones laying around, you can add those, some water, and some aromatic herbs to a stock pot, instant pot, or pressure cooker to make a batch of bone broth at home. Or, you can save a trip to the grocery store by using Dr. Kellyann’s powdered bone broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply add this bone broth to any recipe that calls for liquid bone broth by dissolving one packet in eight ounces of hot water. Cut your total time for any broth-based recipe with this one simple trick!</span></p>

<h3><b>Anytime, Anywhere Bone Broth</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions: Pour contents into bowl and add 8-12 oz. of boiling water. Stir until blended. Add your favorite spices for added flavor.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Can Bone Broth Support Your Health?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When animal bones are slow-cooked, the marrow and connective tissues release health-supporting nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and collagen-packed protein. When you go through our 21-day plan, you can see benefits in many areas of your overall wellness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These can include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight loss</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin, joint, and bone health</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydration</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digestion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metabolism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep health</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extra protein in the broth may give you more control over your appetite and reduce hunger cravings in between meals by keeping you feeling fuller for longer. The extra protein can also play a key role in helping you maintain muscle mass and support healthy blood sugar levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The animal bones also contain gelatin. When our bodies digest gelatin, it is deconstructed into amino acids like glycine, glutamine, and proline. These amino acids are then sent out to wherever the body needs them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and can help support digestive health, natural collagen production, and a healthy metabolism. Glutamine and glycine can also help support the gut lining and your gut microbiome, which can, in turn, support your overall health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bone broths are full of supportive nutrients like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collagen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin D</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin A </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin K </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatty acids</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iron</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zinc</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phosphorus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnesium </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Encourages Healthy Weight Loss</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is low in carbs, sugar, and calories, so it makes sense that, for many, it can help curb cravings and support weight loss goals. The benefits of losing weight are felt on the inside and the outside. When you start to look great, you may start to feel great, too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily incorporate Dr. Kellyann’s bone broth by substituting bone broth for caffeinated or sugary drinks, throwing one of our on-the-go packets in your gym bag, or using it as a base for your favorite soup. And of course, you can embark on our bone broth diet plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By drinking two servings of Dr. Kellyann’s delicious bone broth every day, you can get an extra 32 ounces of protein into your diet, which can help you feel fuller for longer. You can also combine the benefits of bone broth with diet methods like intermittent fasting and low-carb diets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure to save your cup of bone broth for a non-fasting day, as bone broth can break a fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start replacing foods that are high in sugar and carbohydrates with clean foods that are high in protein, you can burn more calories and support your metabolism. The results can be amazing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, our beef and chicken bone broths work with both keto and paleo diets. And, while there are plenty of bone broth recipes that feature non-starchy vegetables and healthy fats (while avoiding artificial sweeteners or legumes),we prefer to enjoy bone broth as-is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, when you’re drinking Dr. Kellyann Petrucci’s high-quality, grass-fed chicken or beef bone broth, why add anything at all?</span></p>
<p><b>Supports Younger-Looking Skin</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can the bone broth diet support your weight loss journey, but the collagen contained in each serving can help support skin health, as well. Unfortunately, one fact of life is that, as we age, our natural ability to produce collagen can diminish. This can even start as early as our 20s.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collagen production starts to decline, that’s when we begin to notice things like sagging skin, hallowed areas around our eyes, and fine lines and wrinkles. The good news is that you can add some collagen back to your body by drinking bone broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, you may see improvements in the tone and texture of your skin. It may even help smoothen the appearance of cellulite. </span></p>
<p><b>Promotes Gut Health</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth can also play an important role in your gut health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gut is also sometimes called the body’s second brain. It’s no wonder, then, that a happy gut can contribute to a happier state of being. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nutrients, proteins, and amino acids contained in bone broth can help coat the lining of your gut and support healthy digestion. Specifically, the amino acids glutamine and glycine both play vital roles in the digestive system. </span></p>
<h3><b>How Else Can You Use Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gut is the epicenter of the body, and a healthy gut can support your overall wellness — so it’s time to start taking gut health seriously. A great way to take advantage of the benefits of bone broth is by using it as part of a detox to support your microbiome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try using Dr. Kellyann’s 5-Day-Cleanse &amp; Reset Kit to get harmful bacteria and toxins in check. This cleansing meal plan includes some of Dr. Kellyann’s favorite cleansing foods like Lemon Sips, Chocolate or Vanilla Super Smoothies, Super Berry Smoothies, and our Lemon Chicken Soup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By pressing the restart button with a bone broth cleanse, you may be able to minimize uncomfortable bloating, digestive discomfort, and even skin concerns. The minerals and nutrients contained in bone broth can support your gut, while collagen can help you lose that stubborn belly fat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, bone broth can fit in a wide range of diets. Those who are on a gluten-free or keto diet should be able to incorporate bone broth into their diet easily. Simply add some veggies, and you have a nutritious and diet-friendly soup that can help you feel full and look amazing.</span></p>

<span style="color: #ff2a00;" data-mce-style="color: #ff2a00;"></span>This 21-Day Bone Broth Diet product bundle gives you all the bone broth you’ll need to be successful on your 21-Day Bone Broth Diet.<br><br>
<p>This bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 boxes of Collagen Broth <meta charset="UTF-8"> <span data-mce-fragment="1">—</span> that's 70 packets of convenient bone broth to-go! </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bone Broth Benefits</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">+ 16g of protein per serving<br data-mce-fragment="1">+ Only 70 calories and less than 1g of carbs<span> </span><br data-mce-fragment="1">+ Just 230mg of sodium per serving<br data-mce-fragment="1">+ No fat / No sugar / No cholesterol<br>+ Cage-free chicken<br>+ Slow-simmered for 8 hours<br>+ Includes 7 individual packets<br>+ Just add hot water and serve! </p>
<h3><b>Anytime, Anywhere Bone Broth</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions: Pour contents into bowl and add 8-12 oz. of boiling water. Stir until blended. Add your favorite spices for added flavor.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Can Bone Broth Support Your Health?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When animal bones are slow-cooked, the marrow and connective tissues release health-supporting nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and collagen-packed protein. When you go through our 21-day plan, you can see benefits in many areas of your overall wellness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These can include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight loss</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin, joint, and bone health</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydration</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digestion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metabolism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep health</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extra protein in the broth may give you more control over your appetite and reduce hunger cravings in between meals by keeping you feeling fuller for longer. The extra protein can also play a key role in helping you maintain muscle mass and support healthy blood sugar levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The animal bones also contain gelatin. When our bodies digest gelatin, it is deconstructed into amino acids like glycine, glutamine, and proline. These amino acids are then sent out to wherever the body needs them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and can help support digestive health, natural collagen production, and a healthy metabolism. Glutamine and glycine can also help support the gut lining and your gut microbiome, which can, in turn, support your overall health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bone broths are full of supportive nutrients like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collagen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin D</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin A </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin K </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatty acids</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iron</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zinc</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phosphorus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnesium </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Encourages Healthy Weight Loss</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is low in carbs, sugar, and calories, so it makes sense that, for many, it can help curb cravings and support weight loss goals. The benefits of losing weight are felt on the inside and the outside. When you start to look great, you may start to feel great, too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily incorporate Dr. Kellyann’s bone broth by substituting bone broth for caffeinated or sugary drinks, throwing one of our on-the-go packets in your gym bag, or using it as a base for your favorite soup. And of course, you can embark on our bone broth diet plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By drinking two servings of Dr. Kellyann’s delicious bone broth every day, you can get an extra 32 ounces of protein into your diet, which can help you feel fuller for longer. You can also combine the benefits of bone broth with diet methods like intermittent fasting and low-carb diets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure to save your cup of bone broth for a non-fasting day, as bone broth can break a fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start replacing foods that are high in sugar and carbohydrates with clean foods that are high in protein, you can burn more calories and support your metabolism. The results can be amazing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, our beef and chicken bone broths work with both keto and paleo diets. And, while there are plenty of bone broth recipes that feature non-starchy vegetables and healthy fats (while avoiding artificial sweeteners or legumes),we prefer to enjoy bone broth as-is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, when you’re drinking Dr. Kellyann Petrucci’s high-quality, grass-fed chicken or beef bone broth, why add anything at all?</span></p>
<p><b>Supports Younger-Looking Skin</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can the bone broth diet support your weight loss journey, but the collagen contained in each serving can help support skin health, as well. Unfortunately, one fact of life is that, as we age, our natural ability to produce collagen can diminish. This can even start as early as our 20s.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collagen production starts to decline, that’s when we begin to notice things like sagging skin, hallowed areas around our eyes, and fine lines and wrinkles. The good news is that you can add some collagen back to your body by drinking bone broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, you may see improvements in the tone and texture of your skin. It may even help smoothen the appearance of cellulite. </span></p>
<p><b>Promotes Gut Health</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth can also play an important role in your gut health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gut is also sometimes called the body’s second brain. It’s no wonder, then, that a happy gut can contribute to a happier state of being. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nutrients, proteins, and amino acids contained in bone broth can help coat the lining of your gut and support healthy digestion. Specifically, the amino acids glutamine and glycine both play vital roles in the digestive system. </span></p>
<h3><b>How Else Can You Use Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gut is the epicenter of the body, and a healthy gut can support your overall wellness — so it’s time to start taking gut health seriously. A great way to take advantage of the benefits of bone broth is by using it as part of a detox to support your microbiome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try using Dr. Kellyann’s 5-Day-Cleanse &amp; Reset Kit to get harmful bacteria and toxins in check. This cleansing meal plan includes some of Dr. Kellyann’s favorite cleansing foods like Lemon Sips, Chocolate or Vanilla Super Smoothies, Super Berry Smoothies, and our Lemon Chicken Soup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By pressing the restart button with a bone broth cleanse, you may be able to minimize uncomfortable bloating, digestive discomfort, and even skin concerns. The minerals and nutrients contained in bone broth can support your gut, while collagen can help you lose that stubborn belly fat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, bone broth can fit in a wide range of diets. Those who are on a gluten-free or keto diet should be able to incorporate bone broth into their diet easily. Simply add some veggies, and you have a nutritious and diet-friendly soup that can help you feel full and look amazing.</span></p>

<h3><b>How Can Bone Broth Support Your Health?</b></h3>
<p><span>Dr. Kellyann's Bone Broth is crafted with one goal in mind: to deliver powerful nourishment to your brain and body in convenient, easy-to-prepare, on-the-go servings.</span><span></span><i data-stringify-type="italic"><span></span></i></p>
<p><span>Consuming 1-2 packets of Dr. Kellyann's Bone Broth per day aids in supporting gut health and is ideal for intermittent fasting, GLP-1 diets, and weight loss programs. It's rich in nutrients, contains 0 sugar, and is high in protein, making it great for diabetics, seniors, and those on carnivore or paleo diets. This delicious bone broth is excellent for recovery, boosting immunity, and supporting skin, hair and nail health.</span></p>
<p><span>We suggest trying it as a savory satisfying snack, meal accompaniment, or wholesome soup base in your favorite recipes.</span><span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-135077" delay="300"> </span></p>
<h3><b>How Can You Use Rosemary Bone Broth in Everyday Cooking?</b></h3>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Kellyann’s nutritious Rosemary Thyme Bone Broth has a savory depth to its flavor that we love to enjoy on its own — but you can also use it as a base for many vegetable or noodle soup recipes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toss in some onions, sea salt, bay leaves, fresh rosemary, black pepper, lemon juice, and veggies for a delicious lemon-rosemary soup. This soup is easy, has a low prep time, and makes for a great on-the-go snack.</span></p>
<div class="s-description">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, combine some diced sweet potato, kale, cooked chicken, a little turmeric, parsley, and chicken bone broth for a gluten-free, keto-friendly stew. The cook time may be a little longer, but this soup is such a mouth-wateringly good source of protein and dietary fiber that it’s worth the wait!</span></p>
<h3><b>Can You Drink Bone Broth if You Follow a Special Diet?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is a low-calorie, low-sugar, and low-carbohydrate superfood. Its low glycemic index makes it a versatile food option, and at two grams of total carbohydrates, it’s also keto and paleo-friendly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth also pairs well with intermittent fasting diets, especially when people are just starting out. With its nutrients and protein content, bone broth is a great way to break your fast in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, our chicken broth is made with real chicken bones and no preservatives. With no total fat, trans fat, or cholesterol, it’s great for everyone! For a more detailed ingredient breakdown, check out our nutritional information by the serving size.</span></p>

<h3><strong>What Are the Nutrients in Bone Broth?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our savory Thai Lemongrass Bone Broth contains vital nutrients that can help support your metabolism and weight loss journey. This bone broth is a twist on our original flavor with the addition of tangy Asian herbs and spices, garlic, ginger, and cilantro, which we’ve added for an extra burst of flavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how you like to spice it up, there’s no denying that this “liquid gold” broth is packed full of healthy ingredients. There’s a reason bone broth is a prime element of many home remedies. Let’s break the nutrients down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth can contain: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Protein</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Protein is essential for keeping your body fueled and may help you cut those mid-afternoon cravings. That’s because protein can actually take longer for your body to digest, which can help you feel full for longer. This is why it’s so important to eat adequate amounts of protein if you are trying to shed extra weight. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Collagen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Organic, grass-fed collagen may help support your body’s natural collagen production. It can also support your skin, hair, nails, muscles, bones, tendons, joints, and so much more. Adding collagen to your diet can help you feel good inside and out!</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Amino acids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There are many amino acids in bone broth, including proline, glycine, glutamine, and hydroxyproline. Your body requires amino acids to make different proteins, which is why it’s important to get enough of them in your everyday diet.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amino acids can also play a role in the decomposition of food, support proper digestion, promote healthy skin, hair, and nails, and contribute to the development of necessary hormones and neurotransmitters. This bone broth packs a punch!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Vitamins and minerals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Each serving of delicious broth can also contain vital nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which can support bone health, energy production, and long-lasting hydration.  </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Is This Bone Broth Keto and Paleo-Friendly?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our bone broths are also wonderful meal additions, or substitutions, for anyone practicing a ketogenic or paleo diet. They’re soy, gluten, sugar, and dairy-free, and they’re also low in carbohydrates and fat while being high in protein to help you feel fuller for longer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are also great at spicing things up if your diet has become boring or repetitive. Get inspired by our wide variety of bone broths, including our Chicken Bone Broth, Beef Bone Broth, Miso Mushroom Bone Broth, and Thai Lemongrass Bone Broth.</span></p>
<p><b>My Bone Broth makes everything easier:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intermittent fasting — replenishes lost nutrients and reduces hunger pangs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dieting — just replace one meal a day with my low-cal bone broth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use in any of my Dr. Kellyann plans, programs, and diets calling for bone broth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use as a recipe substitute for stock or water, or as a base for homemade stews.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An easy and delicious way to support healthy aging and body maintenance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great anytime/anywhere meal you can keep in your purse, locker, desk, or car.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How Can You Use Thai Lemongrass Bone Broth?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many ways to enjoy our satisfying Thai Lemongrass Bone Broth. You can toss in some sea salt and drink a cup in the morning for a quick wake-up-and-go breakfast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also toss in some organic ginger, fresh lemongrass, organic vegetables, scallions, bay leaves, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar or lime juice, and organic spices like organic rosemary or peppercorns. Mix it all up on the stovetop and serve over pho noodles or diced chicken breasts to create a delicious stew.</span></p>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong> Pour contents into bowl and add 8-12 oz. of boiling water. Stir until blended. Sip, savor, and enjoy! </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our French Onion recipe has all the same nutritious qualities as our original Classic Chicken, such as 15g of protein per serving and hydrolyzed collagen to support your skin, bones, and joints. Plus, these natural benefits can support your gut, promote a healthy metabolism, and help you keep your hunger cravings under control.</span></p>

<div class="s-description">
<h3><b>How Can French Onion Bone Broth Support Your Health?</b></h3>
<p><span>Dr. Kellyann's Bone Broth is crafted with one goal in mind: to deliver powerful nourishment to your brain and body in convenient, easy-to-prepare, on-the-go servings.</span><span></span><i data-stringify-type="italic"><span></span></i></p>
<p><span>Consuming 1-2 packets of Dr. Kellyann's Bone Broth per day aids in supporting gut health and is ideal for intermittent fasting, GLP-1 diets, and weight loss programs. It's rich in nutrients, contains 0 sugar, and is high in protein, making it great for diabetics, seniors, and those on carnivore or paleo diets. This delicious bone broth is excellent for recovery, boosting immunity, and supporting skin, hair and nail health.</span></p>
<p><span>We suggest trying it as a savory satisfying snack, meal accompaniment, or wholesome soup base in your favorite recipes.</span></p>
<h3><b>Bone Broth vs. Stock: What’s the Difference?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although made with similar ingredients, bone broth and stock differ by their cooking times. Stock is made by boiling animal bones (usually bovine, poultry, or fish bones) with herbs and spices and a mix of chopped onions, carrots, and celery. This combination of herbs and vegetables is also what gives chicken and beef stock their hearty flavors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth follows a similar cooking process, except the bones must be simmered for at least six hours. Rich and decadent broths are typically slow-cooked for 24 hours or more. Broths can be made with herbs and vegetables, but it’s not required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This extended cook time is what really separates bone broth from ordinary stock. During this process, the bones release nutrients and the collagen proteins inside transform into gelatin, which is what gives the bone broth its rich, hearty texture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the gelatin is digested in the gut, it is broken down further into amino acids. Those amino acids, also called the “building blocks of protein,” are then used to build proteins like collagen and elastin, which can help support your overall wellness.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Can You Cook With French Onion Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Kellyann’s best-selling French Onion Bone Broth is made from grass-fed bovine collagen, has 15 grams of protein in every serving, and has a comforting flavor that you won’t be able to get enough of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This broth is so popular because of its rich and savory caramelized-onion flavor. It packs in flavor but is also low in calories and carbohydrates. You can use it as a substitute for sugary or caffeinated drinks, for meals any time of day, or even for your favorite dry white wine as a way to wind down in the evenings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our French Onion Bone Broth can also be used as a base for a traditional onion au gratin soup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need for this keto French onion soup recipe is some butter (or ghee), yellow onion, garlic cloves, kosher salt, sprigs of fresh thyme for a garnish, bay leaves, black pepper, and a smooth gruyère cheese. Whether you choose to bake it in a dutch oven or prepare it in a slow cooker, each bowl of soup will be more delicious than the last.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it fits with your diet plan, make some homemade crouton appetizers by tossing some baguette slices covered in unsalted butter or olive oil on a baking sheet and broil them until they’re golden brown. If you’re trying to cut the carbs (or if you’re gluten-free), sauté some veggies on medium heat instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This simple recipe is a great way to enjoy the benefits of bone broth while still satisfying your tastebuds. Our bone broths are great as stand-alone meals, but they can also be used to add health benefits to many of your favorite recipes. Plus, our ready-to-eat bone broth can help reduce the total time of your favorite recipes.</span><br></p>

<p>I want your journey toward a healthier lifestyle to be on YOUR terms. I want you to look and feel your best whenever and wherever you want. And my anytime/anywhere single-servings of collagen-rich bone broth are the easiest (and tastiest) way to get there.</p>
<h2>Anytime, Anywhere Bone Broth</h2>
<p>Directions: Pour contents into bowl and add 8-12 oz. of boiling water. Stir until blended. Add your favorite spices for added flavor.</p>
<h3><b>How Do We Make Our Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making bone broth is the same for both liquid and powdered forms — except for the final step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is made by simmering animal bones, connective tissues, and cartilage with a combination of apple cider vinegar, savory herbs, and spices in a slow cooker. Bovine bones and tissues are used for beef bone broth, while whole chicken feet, beaks, bones, and tissues are used to make chicken bone broth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are then simmered on a stovetop for a total cook time of over six hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the slow-cooking process is complete, the broth becomes a gelatinous and nutrient-rich superfood. To make our best-selling bone broth powder, this “liquid gold” is then dehydrated into a powder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Kellyann only uses the bones of hormone-free, grass-fed bovine that hail from Germany and Brazil to make her hydrolyzed collagen powder. Dr. Kellyann’s hydrolyzed collagen is packed full of amino acids that are easy for the body to absorb. These amino acids can help support collagen and protein production in the body. </span></p>
<h3><b>How Can Bone Broth Benefit Your Health?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may know of bone broth as a safe and effective tool to help with weight loss, but there are many other benefits of bone broth, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Dr. Kellyann’s Classic Chicken Bone Broth has 16 grams of added protein in each serving. That protein can help fuel your body and keep you feeling fuller for longer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also contains zero sugars, fats, or cholesterol and is also low in calories, carbohydrates, and saturated fat. This means it pairs perfectly with many weight loss programs and diets, including keto and paleo diets.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 15 to 16 grams of hydrolyzed collagen contained in each Classic Chicken Bone Broth packet can help smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as minimize the effects of sagging skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bodies naturally produce collagen, but as we age, collagen production can slow down. Eating foods that contain collagen and collagen-supporting amino acids is a great way to begin supporting your natural collagen production and skin elasticity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is also rich in vitamins and minerals like calcium, potassium, magnesium, and collagen, thanks to the marrow bones used in bone broth recipes. This nutritious blend of minerals can help support gut health, weight loss, skin health, and overall wellness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amino acids, like glutamine and glycine, can help support your gut microbiome. They may also help support new cell growth, the health of your gut lining, and overall digestion by helping to break down fats more thoroughly. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Recipes Can You Cook With Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is a versatile blank canvas for a myriad of recipes. While we love drinking bone broth on its own, it’s also a wonderful base for gluten-free stew and soup recipes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our favorite ways to incorporate bone broth into a weeknight meal is by combining it with fresh veggies to make a hearty pho. Simply combine some veggies into a large pot or a crock pot, along with our bone broth, peppercorns, sea salt, bay leaves, and aromatic herbs, and cook on high heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in some freshly cooked chicken and some rice noodles, and there you have it! This easy recipe is a great way to use bone broth without adding unnecessary prep time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have some leftover bones laying around, you can add those, some water, and some aromatic herbs to a stock pot, instant pot, or pressure cooker to make a batch of bone broth at home. Or, you can save a trip to the grocery store by using Dr. Kellyann’s powdered bone broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply add this bone broth to any recipe that calls for liquid bone broth by dissolving one packet in eight ounces of hot water. Cut your total time for any broth-based recipe with this one simple trick!</span></p>

<h3><b>Anytime, Anywhere Bone Broth</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions: Pour contents into bowl and add 8-12 oz. of boiling water. Stir until blended. Add your favorite spices for added flavor.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Can Bone Broth Support Your Health?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When animal bones are slow-cooked, the marrow and connective tissues release health-supporting nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and collagen-packed protein. When you go through our 21-day plan, you can see benefits in many areas of your overall wellness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These can include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight loss</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin, joint, and bone health</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydration</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digestion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metabolism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep health</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extra protein in the broth may give you more control over your appetite and reduce hunger cravings in between meals by keeping you feeling fuller for longer. The extra protein can also play a key role in helping you maintain muscle mass and support healthy blood sugar levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The animal bones also contain gelatin. When our bodies digest gelatin, it is deconstructed into amino acids like glycine, glutamine, and proline. These amino acids are then sent out to wherever the body needs them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and can help support digestive health, natural collagen production, and a healthy metabolism. Glutamine and glycine can also help support the gut lining and your gut microbiome, which can, in turn, support your overall health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bone broths are full of supportive nutrients like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collagen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin D</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin A </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin K </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatty acids</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iron</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zinc</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phosphorus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnesium </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Encourages Healthy Weight Loss</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth is low in carbs, sugar, and calories, so it makes sense that, for many, it can help curb cravings and support weight loss goals. The benefits of losing weight are felt on the inside and the outside. When you start to look great, you may start to feel great, too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily incorporate Dr. Kellyann’s bone broth by substituting bone broth for caffeinated or sugary drinks, throwing one of our on-the-go packets in your gym bag, or using it as a base for your favorite soup. And of course, you can embark on our bone broth diet plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By drinking two servings of Dr. Kellyann’s delicious bone broth every day, you can get an extra 32 ounces of protein into your diet, which can help you feel fuller for longer. You can also combine the benefits of bone broth with diet methods like intermittent fasting and low-carb diets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure to save your cup of bone broth for a non-fasting day, as bone broth can break a fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start replacing foods that are high in sugar and carbohydrates with clean foods that are high in protein, you can burn more calories and support your metabolism. The results can be amazing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, our beef and chicken bone broths work with both keto and paleo diets. And, while there are plenty of bone broth recipes that feature non-starchy vegetables and healthy fats (while avoiding artificial sweeteners or legumes),we prefer to enjoy bone broth as-is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, when you’re drinking Dr. Kellyann Petrucci’s high-quality, grass-fed chicken or beef bone broth, why add anything at all?</span></p>
<p><b>Supports Younger-Looking Skin</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can the bone broth diet support your weight loss journey, but the collagen contained in each serving can help support skin health, as well. Unfortunately, one fact of life is that, as we age, our natural ability to produce collagen can diminish. This can even start as early as our 20s.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collagen production starts to decline, that’s when we begin to notice things like sagging skin, hallowed areas around our eyes, and fine lines and wrinkles. The good news is that you can add some collagen back to your body by drinking bone broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, you may see improvements in the tone and texture of your skin. It may even help smoothen the appearance of cellulite. </span></p>
<p><b>Promotes Gut Health</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone broth can also play an important role in your gut health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gut is also sometimes called the body’s second brain. It’s no wonder, then, that a happy gut can contribute to a happier state of being. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nutrients, proteins, and amino acids contained in bone broth can help coat the lining of your gut and support healthy digestion. Specifically, the amino acids glutamine and glycine both play vital roles in the digestive system. </span></p>
<h3><b>How Else Can You Use Bone Broth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gut is the epicenter of the body, and a healthy gut can support your overall wellness — so it’s time to start taking gut health seriously. A great way to take advantage of the benefits of bone broth is by using it as part of a detox to support your microbiome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try using Dr. Kellyann’s 5-Day-Cleanse &amp; Reset Kit to get harmful bacteria and toxins in check. This cleansing meal plan includes some of Dr. Kellyann’s favorite cleansing foods like Lemon Sips, Chocolate or Vanilla Super Smoothies, Super Berry Smoothies, and our Lemon Chicken Soup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By pressing the restart button with a bone broth cleanse, you may be able to minimize uncomfortable bloating, digestive discomfort, and even skin concerns. The minerals and nutrients contained in bone broth can support your gut, while collagen can help you lose that stubborn belly fat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, bone broth can fit in a wide range of diets. Those who are on a gluten-free or keto diet should be able to incorporate bone broth into their diet easily. Simply add some veggies, and you have a nutritious and diet-friendly soup that can help you feel full and look amazing.</span></p>
