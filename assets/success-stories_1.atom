      <![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tick tock, tick tock…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you hear that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the sound of the clock catching up with you! Trust me, I get it. There’s more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rolls</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here, more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aches</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there...There’s more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exhaustion</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everywhere! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the sad truth is, most people believe they’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doomed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to live with extra weight and a body they don't recognize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take </span><b>Malaika</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My weight </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">used</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be very </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistent</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It only fluctuated between seven pounds, and it stayed there until I was about 35. But then I gained 20 pounds in </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">two years</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like so many women, she couldn't figure out what she was doing wrong. She was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">very active — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she went to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gym</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">walked to work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every day…She tried </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> popular diet</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">out there: paleo, keto — you name it, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she tried it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she ate agreed with her. It was like a switch flipped! She turned 35, and suddenly… her body didn't feel like her own anymore. Because it's all downhill from there anyway, right?</span></p>
<p><b><i>No way, baby! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like me, Malaika </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">refused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to back down.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt like </span></i><b><i>something just wasn't right</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I just couldn't figure out what it was. That’s what led me to try Dr. Kellyann's Bone Broth Diet.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you want PROOF of how transformative my life-changing method is… look no further.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Before I started the program, I was </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really frustrated</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By that point, I’d tried </span></i><b><i>everything</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was eating a </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">clean diet</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exercising</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was taking </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">supplements</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and downing </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kombucha</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">probiotics</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yogurt</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I just </span></i><b><i>couldn’t figure out why </i></b><b><i>nothing</i></b><b><i> was going right.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And I’m looking at friends who are feeling great and I was like, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Something must be </span></i><b><i>wrong</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with me."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times have you said that to yourself? How many times have you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">envied the progress</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your friends and co-workers have made and asked the mirror...</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is wrong with </span></i><b><i>me</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen, I hear you. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn't develop the Bone Broth lifestyle because all the diets I'd tried were </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">working</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">… </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d tried them all with no </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lasting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results, and knew I had to find a solution!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">once I had it down</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it made </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all the difference in the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for me, and for Malaika, too:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I have been doing the program </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">again and again</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I keep it in my </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">back pocket</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I'll do the 21-day just to get to what I like to call my </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fighting weight.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And I call it that because it's not like I'm trying to get back to my high school weight or anything like that. I just know that there's a certain weight range where my </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">clothes fit well</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I feel </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">confident</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I feel </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strong</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don't</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feel too </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">skinny</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and everything just looks </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">proportionate</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what I love most about this story? Malaika </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn't</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> find happiness because she tried to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invent a time machine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — it was when she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">committed to herself</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the </span><b>present</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally saw results.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That's why her journey </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke to me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and why I want to share it with you. The fact is, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">our bodies change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How could they not? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, look at me! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This body has taken me through my </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">awkward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teenage years, to a slim, sexy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">20-something</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">carried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">delivered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my sons…And it brought me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><b>you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want YOU to find </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i> <b>fighting weight</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because you deserve to feel your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best, too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The first step? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you </span><b>CAN</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feel your best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">turning back</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the clock...but by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">embracing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all that you are </span><b><i>today</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Believe in </span><b>yourself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Because </span><b>YOU</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got yourself </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Believe that your life can be better… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so much better</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">… than it is right now. You’ve got this! Let's keep going, together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending you my big Italian kiss,</span></p>

    <title>Ben&apos;s Success Story: Losing 22 pounds in 21 days</title>
    <author>
      <name>Kellyann Petrucci</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When was the last time you were determined to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">get something started right away</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The last time you heard about a new challenge and dropped everything to start? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, you might have the same determination as Ben.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After going through multiple diets over the years, Ben just couldn’t find anything that would work. He went through Paleo, Keto, Medifast, and after just turning 40, he was ready to throw in the towel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one Friday, Ben came across my work, saw the numerous reviews and results I’ve gotten for thousands of others over the years… And instantly knew </span><b>this was just what he needed. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same day, he found my Bone Broth Diet book on Amazon and was all ready to order until he realized his copy wouldn’t get there till </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Could you guess what he did instead?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was, like, you know what, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm going to go to Barnes and Noble.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So, I got in the car </span></i><b><i>that day</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hopped down and I actually bought the </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">21-Day Bone Broth Diet.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben’s wife Megan didn’t know about it until he came back, but the minute she heard about the diet, she was ready to do this as a team:  </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She was sold within, you know, five minutes, and </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that Sunday we started</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after 21 days, they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lost </span><b>10%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their body weight:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “After 21 days, </span></i><b><i>I lost 22.2 pounds</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I lost </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">four inches off my chest</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost five inches off my waist</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I mean, I feel great.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t believe it either, but just look at these before-and-after pictures! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his waistline, Ben has turned back the hands of time on his face, too!</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting bags under my eyes</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">puffiness around my cheeks</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Within the first </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">two weeks after drinking bone broth</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><b><i>I noticed a glow.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I started to get moisture on it because I was telling my wife: ‘</span></i><b><i>My face feels tight.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, just look at how he is glowing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/7575/files/wbGmhFfxwgQLLoq9ZCVWRB_480x480.jpg?v=1620152943" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But like so many of my customers, the results went far beyond appearance for Ben...You see, as a former paramedic, Ben knew how important </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blood pressure gets with age</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he started to notice a difference: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wear a Fitbit all the time and I know a lot of people are worried about blood pressure. Mine was always just mildly high </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">around 78, which is not good</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But after a week of doing the diet, I noticed my heart rate is now </span></i><b><i>52 resting</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last time it was this low was </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my early 20s</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in great shape.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with this newfound Tiger Blood energy, he’s also seen a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">big boost in confidence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The energy and the confidence coincide together, so </span></i><b><i>the more confident you feel, the more energy you have.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s like, ‘Oh yeah, I'm ready to go out and do stuff.’”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one thing he’s also mentioned (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is something I stress all the time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is how my Bone Broth Diet has changed his way of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thinking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I'm training my mind and my body to </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn how to eat right again</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is like </span></i><b><i>mind and body training</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and when I get hungry, I tell myself, "It's okay to be hungry. You just </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn how to take care of your body</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I don't even know if I've ever learned how to do that, to be honest.” </span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I say it all the time, </span><b>this is a mental game!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one that requires lots of learning about your body, how you can change </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aspects of your life to</span><b> create a new lifestyle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But like Ben, you can’t wait to start tomorrow or next week… you have to become determined to start </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">right now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, exactly where you are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because good things </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just come to those who wait</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, good things come to those who make things </span><b>happen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben </span><b>didn’t </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">wait. He made his health a priority. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he got what he deserved. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I know you deserve more, too!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending you my big Italian kiss,</span></p>

    <title>Nancy&apos;s Success Story: Total Reset</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy’s commitment to her health paid off… in more ways than one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to introduce you to Nancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy has been a customer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">since 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she's been with me for a while</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">… and she's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted the DKA lifestyle in a way I've never seen before. She is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">guiding light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">listening to her body:</span></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Sometimes I want to </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be more strict</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so I follow the </span></i><b><i>10-day slimdown</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sometimes I </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">need a reboot</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I do a </span></i><b><i>Cleanse and Reset</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other times, I just want to</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eat normally… but in a healthy way.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That's what the </span></i><b><i>Bone Broth diet</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taught me: how to eat healthy."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this year was tough, even for a pro like Nancy. She fell into a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress slump</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when quarantine upended her schedules. Her work routine changed. Her ability to see her friends changed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt </span><b>stressed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>isolated</b><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy began to overeat and over-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">snack. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She comforted herself with all the wrong choices... instead of choosing whole, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> foods to nourish and fuel her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she stopped </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trusting her gut</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost her bubbly energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and just felt </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">...</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of breath</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">...</span><b>Bloated. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this self-care rockstar knew </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what to do.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It was time to come back. And I knew the Cleanse and Reset would be the perfect way to do that.</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was amazing the difference that I felt immediately. I felt so much better. My head was better. My skin started clearing up. So many good things started to happen."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn't that so inspiring? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when she felt </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lousy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nancy knew she needed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take a step back</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>reset</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">get herself back on track</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she did it! </span></p>]]>

    <title>Jackie&apos;s Success Story: Losing 11.5 Pounds</title>
    <author>
      <name>Kellyann Petrucci</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">first</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thing you do when you find something that actually works? You share it! With a friend, a family member, or the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it feels AMAZING to have discovered the secret to a better life — and you want others to experience it, too. And that’s exactly what happens within my DKA community. In fact, </span><b>that’s how Jackie found my Bone Broth Diet!</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main driver was one of my friends had been on it, and I saw the before and after results…I was like, wow.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And almost immediately, she went and bought my book and got STARTED — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all because of that </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> friend! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But do you know what I love the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">most</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Jackie’s story?</span></p>
<p><b>She didn’t do it by herself…</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, she had me in her corner cheering her on, but she also had a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">group of close friends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to motivate her.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We did this as a group. There was five of us in total. We were texting each other every day. We would send an update at our weigh-ins. I think that really helped keep us motivated.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They even had weekly group dinners! But the transformation didn’t stop with the group, because </span><b>Jackie had started a chain reaction.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, </span><b>after losing 11.5 pounds,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jackie went on a trip to Cancun and posted her vacation picture to Facebook…</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was like, ‘Well damn, I look good!’ And I posted it to Facebook… And I’ve got to tell you, there were </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exes coming out of the woodwork</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Then </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my brothers</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they would give me an underhanded compliment…But </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even for my mom</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pick up the phone or comment on it, she goes, ‘Honey, you look </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good.’”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know I love to hear that! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And her results were </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so inspiring</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that her mom and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mothers in her accountability group </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">started my program as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! In fact, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Jackie’s accountability group experienced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transformative results</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and not just in looks but in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lifestyle.</span></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The broth is not going anywhere. That's just going to be in my life for as long as I live. It's just something that I love doing…I love the benefits of it.</span></i><b><i> I feel good about myself again.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thank you for reminding me of the healthy living we all need to maintain.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t tell you how much those words mean to me. Just the thought of bringing people together, and helping them feel and look their best is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my life’s joy!</span></p>

    <title>Lindsay&apos;s Success Story: Kicking Cravings to The Curb</title>
    <author>
      <name>Kellyann Petrucci</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your cravings control you? Find out how to flip the script.</span></p>
<p><b>Are you ready to kick those cravings to the curb? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is true in every battle, the first rule is to </span><b>know your enemy. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">But so many of my patients get this confused — your enemy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">isn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> low willpower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your enemies are actually</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">leptin resistance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dopamine.</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I know you’re probably thinking, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about, lady?” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me break it down for you…</span><b>Leptin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hormone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tells you whether or not you have enough stored energy to get things done. I call it your “</span><b>hunger trigger</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” because when its levels get too low, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you start to crave food.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that trigger worked well for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands of years </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">until we started eating a diet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overloaded with carbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because when you eat too many carbs, your body gets massive doses of leptin…So, over time, you become </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">leptin resistant,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your brain stops receiving the “I’m full” signal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s where the cravings begin…You start</span><b> feeling powerful urges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more carb-based, leptin-loaded foods, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like cookies and bagels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — even though you may have eaten only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 hours before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But leptin is not the only hormone working against you, there’s also </span><b>dopamine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can make you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to eat, not because you’re hungry, but </span><b>because you’re bored.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And guess what? You can get hooked on dopamine from alcohol, sweet foods, dairy — even your phone! Basically, if it makes you feel good, it can cause a spike in dopamine. </span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think Lindsay describes her battle with dopamine best… </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cravings I had, I think were really sort of everything, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sweet, salty, wine.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  But I think it was </span></i><b><i>boredom</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, honestly, because, you know, I really enjoy food and drink in general…And especially during the pandemic just, it's like my one joy.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But when you can understand your enemies and how they work, like Lindsay did with the Bone Broth Diet, you can really start to make a change…</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the current state of the world, a little bit of weight had crept back on, and I just </span></i><b><i>found myself falling back into some not great habits</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was feeling a little sluggish and, lots of sugar, lots of drinking. And I really needed a </span></i><b><i>reset</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to kind of get rid of some of those cravings</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Lindsay, I think we all can agree that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">our cravings can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">get a grip on us sometimes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get caught up in pasta once in a while! But, if you don’t keep your cravings under control, they can end up </span><b>wreaking havoc</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your body, just as they did to her. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was bloated.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> My stomach was not feeling well, I </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn't sleeping well</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My skin was really broken</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I knew also that it was my eating habits and just too much sugar. It was kind of </span></i><b><i>getting a little out of control.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s good news, though! By replacing those heavy carbs and sugar with </span><b>healthy, filling fats</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>clean protein</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like Bone Broth!), you’ll notice your cravings subside </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantially </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">— just like Lindsay’s did! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if your cravings don’t seem to be going away that easily? Well, this fact that I learned long ago may help you put things in perspective:  </span></p>
<p><b>The average craving lasts only 3 minutes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 minutes...Think about it, you can withstand </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just about anything </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for 3 minutes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, my recommendation is this: try doing something </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">than giving into your craving. That could be anything from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drinking a glass of water</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">distracting yourself</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by doing a chore, getting out of the house, or calling a friend — just for 3 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And trust me — even with these tips and tricks — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">things won’t change overnight</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Like Lindsay, </span><b>the key to beating cravings is simply to build a healthy, balanced lifestyle.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And remember, as long as you’re following a clean, nutrient-rich diet 80% of the time, it’s perfectly okay to indulge in a little “fairy dust food” the other 20%! </span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending you my big Italian kiss, </span></p>]]>

    <title>Tara&apos;s Success Story: Overcoming Her Sugar Cravings</title>
    <author>
      <name>Kellyann Petrucci</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your body ever just <i>crave</i> sugar? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost like your brain jumps in the driver’s seat, throws you in the passenger seat, and all of a sudden you’re in your pantry looking for a tasty snack… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what was happening to Tara, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At first, you would think she’s doing great: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she works out a lot, she eats clean, she goes to yoga</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  But there was one little thing that was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping her from reaching her goals… </span><b>Sugar. </b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, sugar</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was her </span><b>worst enemy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and she battled with it every single day.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so addictive,”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she would always say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And although sometimes she was able to keep herself away from sugar for days at a time…She eventually would give into that sugar demon, and feel like she had to start all over again. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really wanted to clean out my system, just so I could feel better. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My energy was just so low</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — I wanted a reset.”</span></i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Tara decided to try my <a href="https://drkellyann.com/collections/cleanse-and-reset/products/new-and-improved-v3-5-day-cleanse-and-reset-kit" target="_blank" title="cleanse and reset" rel="noopener noreferrer">5-Day Cleanse &amp; Reset Kit</a> as a jumpstart to getting back on track.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel great. I feel so much lighter, like </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have more energy</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s so easy to wake up in the morning and go to bed now.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the 5th day, she lost</span><b> 2 inches</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off her </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">waist and hips</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My stomach was 29 inches the first day; by day 5, I was at 27 inches. Same with the hips; </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was at 39 on the first day, then 37 by the last!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because my cleanse is so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">convenient</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tara was able to manage it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">while</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she was working throughout the week.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m someone who works a lot. I pretty much worked the </span></i><b><i>entire time</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this cleanse, but because everything was portioned in a package, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could take it with me easily</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, she was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> able to </span><b>kick her cravings for sugar</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and take back control over her body again!</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't even have the cravings to want the sugar that I wanted before.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Like it just doesn't feel good to go into my system after doing this, after doing such a </span></i><b><i>wonderful</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thing for my body.”</span></i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And although her cravings are still there (we’re all human!), she feels like she now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has the tools</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">control her cravings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meaning, </span><b>her cravings don’t control her</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could do the same? What if you could completely </span><b>understand your cravings and desire</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for sugar or fast food?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Could you imagine how that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">change your life</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like how it did for Tara)? How much more</span><b> energy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you could have? How </span><b>proud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would you be of yourself for standing firm in your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commitment and determination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to share Tara’s story with you to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">show you what’s possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you learn to understand your cravings and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take control of your body</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once again. </span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have an important question to ask you… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you ever feel like you’re doing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re supposed to — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eating healthy, exercising, going to bed on time, hydrating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — but you’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">still </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not seeing a change? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been there and I know it can be so </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">discouraging</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">working and working on a goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only to go nowhere. And what do we often do when this happens? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tell ourselves it’s our fault.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We punish ourselves, take the fun away, restrict ourselves to super-strict diets, and say goodbye to “fairy-dust foods.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’m here to tell you — </span><b>you don’t have to do that anymore. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need you to hear me when I say this: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You DO NOT deserve punishment for enjoying your life. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You DO NOT need to restrict yourself to crazy diets. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You DO NOT have to say goodbye to fun. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><i></i><b>Because you are worth so much more than a number on a scale. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you don’t want to listen to me,</span><b> listen to Tatia. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her story is one that I relate to down to my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">core</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And I think you will, too. Check her out.</span></p>

    <title>Jill&apos;s Success Story: A Lifestyle Change</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today I want to let you in on  the most important lesson my community member, </span><b>Jill,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learned when she and her family started following my Bone Broth Diet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh! My bad. She doesn't even use the often-dreaded D-word! No, Jill took a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">completely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new approach to healthy eating, and it was just the thing she needed to make </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">major transformational moves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just look at the result! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/7575/files/Jill_Transformation_600x600.png?v=1618519892" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk about a transformation! Jill was able to </span><b>lose 11.2 lbs, and 7” total</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">first cycle </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the Bone Broth Diet! And even more the second time! But what she gained was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so much more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">… </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill’s story absolutely sets me on fire because she approached this journey </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the way I hope that everyone will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you itching to know her secret? I’ll give you a hint: this is how Jill sees it… </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">isn’t</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a diet for us, </span></i><b><i>it's a lifestyle change</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, like many of us, Jill struggled with her health and body image for years, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">obsessing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over her meals. That was until she learned to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trust</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">one person</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who knows her body </span><b>better than anyone else</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">… Herself!</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I learned to </span></i><b><i>trust my body</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to know when I was </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly hungry</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and [learned] that I could </span></i><b><i>teach my body</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to burn fat for fuel."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does trusting yourself seem like a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wild </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">concept? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it does, I get it, believe me. It can be difficult to cut through the jungle of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">'advice'</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> given to you when you start on </span><b>your very own health journey</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Everyone seems to have their own opinion about how much and how often you should eat...whether they're a nutritionist or not! (Fun fact: most of them aren’t.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I'm here to tell you the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most important</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> piece of advice you'll ever hear. And it’s the key to Jill’s success…Are you ready? </span><b>There is </b><b>no</b> <b><i>one right</i></b><b> answer. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret is... </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">there is no secret.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Because the truth is that </span><b>we are </b><b><i>all</i></b><b> different</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have different needs, different body compositions, different health journeys.So how did Jill see such amazing results? By embracing a </span><b>total mindset makeover.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jill found the Bone Broth Diet, she felt </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">empowered</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take the right steps for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">her</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> body. So she </span><b>hit the ground running</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">completely changed her relationship with food.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I learned to </span></i><b><i>trust</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the food and portions I was eating was going to </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">help me and not hurt me</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like so many others, Jill found the ancient health secret that </span><b>changed everything</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">... and she saw </span><b><i>results! </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's because she didn’t just try a couple bowls of bone broth and </span><b>return to her old, unhealthy, obsessive way of doing things</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She realized that simply drinking bone broth every day </span><b>without changing her habits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">going to shift the scale. And she knew she had to do a complete 180 on her health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Jill changed her mindset to one of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">determination and resilience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and dug into my </span><a href="https://drkellyann.com/blogs/recipes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">library of convenient recipes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and products… not just to catapult herself into the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best shape of her life,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but to </span><b>create healthy meals for her </b><b><i>entire family</i></b><b>.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The recipes in both of Dr. Kellyann’s Bone Broth Diet books are </span></i><b><i>easy to follow</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even for more novice chefs, like myself. I love that I can make </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthy</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">delicious</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meals for my family — and </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we don’t miss the carbs!</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>That's the best part! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knows that she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t have to starve herself</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or stress over </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">every single bite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see </span><b>life-changing results. </b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am free from </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">calorie counting</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">point tracking</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">weighing and measuring my foods</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I have finally found a program that allows me to feel </span></i><b><i>free from the chains of food obsession</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For that, I am eternally grateful."</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the kinds of stories that get me out of bed every morning and what keeps me writing to you every week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want you to make the choice to do a </span><b>mindset makeover… </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To feel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">empowered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take </span><b>control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your health…To learn how to block out the noise that’s coming from every direction…And to </span><b>trust your body.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because you already have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you need to change your life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m just here to encourage you along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending you my big Italian kiss,</span></p>

    <title>Leatrice&apos;s Success Story: Finding Something That Works</title>
    <author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope this works…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times have you said this to yourself? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve said it more times than I can even remember. But think of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">relief</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">excitement</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you feel when it actually WORKS!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pure joy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is exactly what </span><b>Leatrice experienced</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/7575/files/DKA_Customer_Weight_Loss_Leatrice_website_600x600.png?v=1618519182" alt="weight loss transformation"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of eating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all the right things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: non-GMO, fresh foods, gluten-free, dairy-free, cutting out processed foods…The scale just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wouldn’t budge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Leatrice.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve done several things and </span></i><b><i>nothing worked</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was just </span></i><b><i>completely frustrated</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I got up there in the years and found out that everything is 10 times harder. Your metabolism just says, ‘Nah, I'm not gonna work anymore.’ And it doesn't matter what you do, you know, you can kill yourself working out and dieting...”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this sound familiar? It did for me once upon a time, which is exactly why I developed my </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanse &amp; Reset</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the first place! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And both Leatrice and I are living proof that </span><b>it’s never too late to transform your health. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at 63, Leatrice is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> example of what’s possible when you finally find the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">right mindset and routine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I finally feel like I turned the corner with this. It </span></i><b><i>finally jump-started everything.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She even lost 5 lbs on my Cleanse &amp; Reset! But you know what? </span><b>It wasn’t all about weight for Leatrice.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel much better. My </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">skin</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feels better. My </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hair</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feels better… Just all over, it is an </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotional sense of wellbeing</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I feel. So, it’s not just physical. It just is a </span></i><b><i>mind-body thing</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is what I hope gets through and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inspires you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you finally make the decision to put yourself — and your </span><b>health</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — first, every part of you transforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Body, heart, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mind. Changing your life doesn’t have to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complicated.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It can be as simple as one single choice… and you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see results, with </span><b>discipline</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>perseverance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because I’m in your corner, just like I was in Leatrice’s.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m so thrilled that I found her. I've found somebody that does something that </span></i><b><i>works for my age group</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I'm so thrilled about that. This is it for me.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it can be it for you too. No matter if you choose to try the Cleanse &amp; Reset, commit to my 21-day Bone Broth Diet, or just give an 80/20 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lifestyle a try… the </span><b>choice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is what it takes to transform your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are you waiting for? </span>Check out Leatrice's full video:</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to tell you a story about a woman named Sandy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandy’s story, like so many others, is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatable, and a heartbreaking tale that I hear all too often.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandy had struggled with her health her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life. She didn’t like the picture on her work badge. She felt stuck in the endless loop of fad diets and yo-yo results. And she was tired of feeling sluggish, run-down, and tired </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all the time.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she went looking for a solution... and found </span><b>bone broth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Sandy didn’t just sip on bone broth a couple times and then move on to the next thing. She truly embraced every part of the Bone Broth Lifestyle, and it changed her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire life.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sandy got real with her goals, hit the ground running,  and her results were </span><b>astounding</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<br>
<p><strong>She lost:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>24 pounds</li>
<li>
<i>Several</i> inches</li>
<li>and THREE pant sizes!<b> <br><br></b>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But what she gained was so much more: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher energy </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthier hair, skin, and nails </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better sleep hygiene </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confidence through the roof</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she even says that she </span><b>looks forward to shopping </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">now!! Of course she does! Check her out! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean just </span><b>LOOK</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at her </span><b>energy! </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandy was </span><b><i>beautiful </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">before she started this lifestyle, but her newfound glow and confidence has made her </span><b><i>irresistible. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she notices it, too! </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh man my SKIN....it is </span></i><b><i>glowing</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plus, my hair is </span></i><b><i>longer</i></b> <b><i>and</i></b> <b><i>thicker</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I can’t get over how different my </span></i><b><i>face, neck and even my arms look.”</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her story wasn’t a fluke! Sandy, and so many others like her, found the</span><b> ancient health secret </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that changed everything, and saw lasting results because she didn’t do it halfway. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fasting, collagen coffee, Dr. Kellyann protein, and bone broth are all </span></i><b><i>essential parts of my daily routine.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, instead of just counting on bone broth, Sandy tapped into my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">arsenal of convenient and delicious — LIFE-CHANGING — products, and uses them to help catapult her to her best health. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><b><i>I exercise daily now</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of 3 times a week </span></i><b><i>because it makes me feel good</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of tired like when I first started!” </span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you read that right. Sandy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks forward </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to exercising! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the key is, she doesn’t have to starve herself or exercise for hours every day to see </span><b>life changing results.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In fact, she leans into the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lifestyle </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and is learning how to make it work for her.  </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My hubby and I like to </span></i><b><i>eat out</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to socialize and relax. So when we go out, I order healthy protein, skip the chips and bread, and stick to water. I’m so excited because </span></i><b><i>even eating out, I continue to lose weight</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thanks to using just a few tricks in Dr. Kellyann’s book!”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you thought that wasn’t impressive enough, you’ll really love this.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s crazy is I no longer snack on candy because I love the </span></i><b><i>collagen bars.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Plus, the </span></i><b><i>chocolate protein</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is like a treat! So yummy. </span></i><b><i>I’ve even been off of soda for 6 months now.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When I have that craving, I hear Dr. Kellyann talk about killing my good gut bugs and go straight for the cold lemon water instead.” </span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if you’ve ever been beholden to a soda addiction, but that sugar demon is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nasty</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> guy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guess what though? By treating the Bone Broth Diet as a </span><b>lifestyle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sandy crushed her sugar addiction with </span><b>EASE! </b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>“I don’t feel like I’m on a diet.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After three weeks, it just felt like a habit, that I’ve turned into a lifestyle. I know the timeline is different for each person, but i<strong>t’s a mental thing</strong>.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember what I’m always telling you about mindset? It. Is. Absolutely. Everything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To succeed — to truly reach your goals and go for it in life — </span><b>you have to stand in your truth. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When all of those </span><b>gnats</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fly around your ears — those external voices of naysayers, discouragers, haters, —  and try to bring you down, you have the power to swat them aside and </span><b>keep going. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you have to do is center yourself, stand in your truth, and stay the course. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how you’re going to see lasting change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Sandy says, </span><b>It’s a mindset thing. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to how she ends her story.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t be more excited that this is a </span></i><b><i>lifestyle change</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of a diet, because I know I can keep the weight off and continue feeling healthy. I am beyond grateful and am sooo amazed! I love all her tips — Dr. Kellyann is an awesome motivator. I truly could go on and on about the </span></i><b><i>positive changes Bone Broth did for me. </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you so much Dr. Kellyann. This has </span></i><b><i>changed my life</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dramatically.” </span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why I do what I do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">...</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To change your life, </span><b><i>dramatically.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see you. I know how valuable you are. </span><b>And I hope when you look in the mirror, you see it, too. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending you my big Italian Kiss,</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong>Hi Dr. Kellyann,</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just wanted to let you know that I've still been following the Bone Broth and Collagen way of life, and I have not gained back one single pound since losing my weight over the summer! My total weight loss has been 35 pounds, and I feel so much better than I did. I have more energy and ambition and I have a much healthier digestive system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get lots of compliments on how good I look "for my age", which some people may take as a slight insult, but I don't. For almost 52 years old, I don't think I look that age at all, and I certainly don't feel it.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I live without bloating and am going to start a yoga program after the holidays are over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although my actual, current weight is lower than it says on my driver's license, which is amazing, I noticed my smaller clothes don't all fit great. I think it's because I do absolutely no exercise. I came to the conclusion that yoga may be the best way for me to tone and re-shape myself while keeping the blood flowing properly and basically exercising without the strain and stress. Looking forward to a great 2019 and I still owe it all to you getting the word out there about Bone Broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I felt so good about myself that my self-esteem was better which allowed me to go on a job interview for a job I really wanted and put my best foot forward. <em>I GOT THE JOB!</em> I'm working as the Special Education Census Clerk for a Regional School Department! Long title, but great job, and only about 5 minutes from my home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know I wouldn't have even applied at my heavier, more depressed self, so I thank you for helping me get my life back on track. I actually feel like I have something to offer the world again.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, due to the new job and me not being able to sip from a pot of Bone Broth stewing on the stove all day, I found Organic Bone Broth Powder online. I know I don't use it as directed, but I wanted to be sure I was getting the benefits of Bone Broth by taking it in one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, and I know it sounds a little crazy, I actually sprinkle Bone Broth Powder on just about everything I eat. It's especially good sprinkled on tuna salad or chicken salad, or the like, which I have on Rye Bread.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rye doesn't bother me like Wheat, or God forbid White, and it doesn't bloat me out or make me gain weight. I don't know why, but my body processes it fine, so I just go with it. The Bone Broth Powder has no taste, and it actually seems to enhance the flavor of everything. I just think of it as "sprinkle cheese" and it's a definite Blessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, I figured I'd send you a few pictures to show you my success. The first picture, of heavy me at 215 pounds, is from July 4th, 2018. The next picture of me, in light blue, is me at the end of August, 2018, at 185 pounds when I sent you my Thank You email. The last picture was taken at Christmas, and that's me at 180 pounds. I love the fact that I follow the 80/20 aspect of the diet and don't feel like I'm restricting myself at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one "diet" that works and I tell everyone about it and it is so easy that I know I'll stick to it, hopefully, for the rest of my life.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And, yes, you can use any of my testimonial you like, because it's all 100 percent true and I'm proud to say it.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks again so much and Happy New Year!!!</span></p>
<p><strong>Perry Bloomer Jr</strong></p>
<p>Wow! Perry’s results are amazing. What a renewed energy and boost of confidence this must bring to his life. Doing this diet can encourage you to have the confidence you need to go after the other things you desire in different areas in your life.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Dr. Kellyann,</strong></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just wanted to take a minute and share my success story with you.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">My whole life I have struggled with my weight. I’ve tried dieting, restriction, exercise, and I could never find any combination that truly worked.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In November of 2017, the man of my dreams proposed. After two years of dating, we’d both become quite comfortable and gained a few pounds. I wasn’t happy, but allowed the holidays to be an excuse for putting off making changes.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come February, I decided to go wedding dress shopping. I found a dress that I loved! I didn’t like how it looked at the time, but considering it would take about 5 months for the dress to be made there was no sense of urgency.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">After attending the wedding of my then fiancé’s best friend and fretting over what to wear, I decided I had to make a change.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">My fiancé’s mom told me about her having done the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kellyanns-Bone-Broth-Diet-Inches/dp/1635650259/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bone Broth Diet</a> a few years prior and losing 50 lbs. She also wanted to lose some weight so we decided together to begin at the end of May.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the diet I was 164.4 lbs. I started May 28th. I was diligent. I did two broth days a week, starting the broth after my coffee, and continuing until about 5pm.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would have a snack of mixed nuts and make dinner. I wasn’t going to be the type to spend a whole day without having a meal.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued with the diet strict for 10 weeks.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The first 6 weeks I didn’t exercise. I lost around 20 lbs then another 12 in the weeks 7-10. I am now down to 123.6 lbs. Overall weight loss of 40.8 lbs.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stopped the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kellyanns-Bone-Broth-Diet-Inches/dp/1635650259/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bone Broth Diet</a> after 10 weeks and continued with the 80/20 maintenance plan and regular exercise. By the time I took my dress to get altered, I was swimming in it.</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb 3, 2018 - I said yes to the dress.</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">September 13, 2018 - Dress fitting.</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">November 3, 2018 - Wedding day!</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">All I can say, is thank you. I will use this method of healing and health for the rest of my life!</span></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sincerest Regards,</strong> <strong>Brittany Fraser, Esq.</strong></em></p>
<p>Wow! Brittany’s results are fabulous. What a renewed energy this must bring to her life. Doing this diet with a friend or family member allows you to not only get mental and emotional support when you hit a craving or are experiencing the “carb flu” but also lets you share the food and the cooking during your diet.</p>]]>

    <title>The Secret to Success</title>
    <author>
      <name>Alex Wittenberg</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say I love hearing about your successes is an understatement. As a doctor and author your successes are the lifeblood of what I do.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been so many incredible success stories on both the </span><a href="https://drkellyann.com/pages/bone-broth-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone Broth Diet</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now </span><a href="https://drkellyann.com/pages/10-day-belly-slimdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10-Day Belly Slimdown</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I am amazed by them all.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">What I love most about these success stories are that these people committed to a healthier lifestyle and diet and are not giving up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may have some bumps in the road, but they are committed and correct-course when needed. And that is the key to success!</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my favorite success stories is Margie. Margie used both the 21-Day </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone Broth Diet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10-Day Belly Slimdown</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for amazing results.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Bone Broth Diet Margie went from a size 14 to a size 6! She lost 14.5 pounds on her first round and another 8 pounds on second round. Between those rounds she modified the Bone Broth Diet a bit so she could enjoy a few glasses of wine a week and she still lost another 5.2 pounds.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Completing rounds of the Bone Broth Diet as needed over the course of 11 months, Margie lost a total of 46 pounds!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And regarding that accomplishment, Margie says,</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Never felt better about myself. This will be my weight loss go to and maintenance plan for life! Put in the effort! You will get great results!”</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">After the holidays and new year, and one more round of the Bone Broth Diet, Margie decided to tackle a round of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10-Day Belly Slimdown</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and her results were just as impressive. Margie says the scale showed just 1.4 pounds lost, but as you can see, and as Margie points out, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over all the pic shows more belly fat lost and that is the goal.”</span></i></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-12174 aligncenter" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/7575/files/Margie-10-day.png" alt="" width="368" height="426"><b></b></p>
<p><b>Don’t think that Margie has more willpower or determination than you can muster up!</b><br> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Margie was a self-proclaimed yo-yo dieter since her early 20s, and found most diets left her feeling tired and regaining the weight lost was inevitable. Once Margie found the Bone Broth Diet at her local library, she jumped right in and after a few touch-and-go days, her body adjusted to fewer carbs.</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I suddenly stopped feeling that constant hunger I’ve struggled with my whole life,” she says.</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Margie, 47 at the time she started the Bone Broth Diet, said,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I felt amazing—clear-headed, energetic, happier. My skin became younger and my cellulite smoothed out. I stopped losing hair. And I could literally see my body fat melting away!” </span></i></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>How she keeps it off...</b>
</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margie says she keeps the weight off </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“by incorporating 2 mini-fasts per week and eating a low carb, low sugar, higher fat diet to keep my body in ketosis.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she does it without being on the treadmill for hours and hours…</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I do not exercise at all and this is the first time I have ever lost this much weight without killing myself with exercise to get there.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margie has also told us her health improvements have been more than just weight loss and have included </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“a glowing skin complexion, healthy shiny hair and beautiful strong nails that grow quickly. The inflammation and pain from my golfers elbow has gone way down. I have no more bloating or intestinal issues and overall, I feel healthy, happy and content.”</span></i> <img class="size-full wp-image-12175 aligncenter" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/7575/files/Margie-Skin.png" alt="" width="544" height="546"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margie you inspire us everyday to keep getting the message out there!</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope Margie inspires you too! </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And we agree 100% with Margie...</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a no-nonsense diet that will improve your life, no question about it!” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “When you set your mind to it, you can do it!”</span></i></p>
<p><strong>Keep thinking big and living BOLD!</strong></p>

    <title>Polly&apos;s Success Story - More Energy and Lower Cholesterol at 66!</title>
    <author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“I am so grateful to everyone here for your honesty, humor and inspiration. I did not take a photo or measurements before the 10-day (other than weight) so I thought I would discuss my full journey on BBD and being a fan of Dr. Kellyann.</em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The “before” photo is from May of 2015 - I really don’t have any for the 2 years after that because I was even more sick, tired and heavy. The “after” photo is this morning, after completing the 10-day challenge. I found the 10-day to be a fun break, and I am going back to the full 21-day program today!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I began the BBD in May of 2017. <strong>In 7 1/2 months I have lost 42 pounds and I am wearing a size 10 petite again</strong> (okay, it’s Talbots “curvy” style but that counts, I am sure). My blood sugar is normal, cholesterol is fantastic. I am jogging at least an hour every morning on the beach.<strong> My energy level is better than when I was in my 20’s.</strong> I just turned 66. I have not been perfect re: staying on track - I still have a glass of wine <img class="Emoji" title=":wine_glass:" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNgYAAAAAMAASsJTYQAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="🍷"> when at a restaurant with friends! But for the most part, this way of eating is easy. I’d like to let go of another 20 pounds, but even if I don’t I will stay with the BBD! </em></span><em>”</em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Polly </span></p>
<p>Polly is 42 lbs down, her energy has returned and she is committed to a Bone Broth Diet way of life. Her great experience on the 10-Day Belly Slimdown supplemented her Bone Broth Lifestyle! An hour jog on the beach each morning is such an enviable exercise routine, and to be wearing a size 10 must feel absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>Polly, congratulations on your success and on adopting the Bone Broth Lifestyle!</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“My name is Kathy and I wanted to thank you for introducing me to the magic of bone broth. </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>On September 6, 2016, I began my journey back to feeling (and looking) terrific. On that day I weighed 171 pounds. On March 6, 2017, exactly 6 months later, I weighed 131 pounds and have maintained that weight ever since. But, the best part was how I felt! At the age of 54 I was overweight, arthritic and a shell of my former self. <strong>Today, my skin is glowing, soft and supple. My joints feel like they did 20 years ago.</strong> Really. My 21 year old daughter is jealous of my skin! </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Now 55, people are constantly complimenting me on how I look. I preach your diet and recommend your book to everyone who asks how I did it. </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I just wanted you to know that with your help, I turned the clock. So if anyone doubts it, I am a living testament.</em></span><em>”</em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Kathy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span> <strong>Kathy is 40 lbs down</strong> <strong>and she is feeling so much better with less and less arthritic spells. </strong></p>
<p>Why does the Bone Broth Diet work for Kathy? It's simple science. With the Bone Broth Diet, you rewire your body to become a natural fat burner. You start by healing your gut, because a leaky gut can lead to obesity and disease. Next, you load up your body with foods that encourage fat burning and natural collagen production. You cut out the toxins and support your body's natural healthy systems. This is why the Bone Broth Lifestyle will always work better—especially long-term—because instead of just counting calories, you're making all your body's cells work better.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><em>"I lost 30 pounds in 4 months on the Bone Broth Diet. I am an emotional eater and after years of keto and eating/feeling great my 88 year old dad fell and that triggered me. </em> <em>I gained 30 lbs and had NO willpower left. Even though his recovery was fast and successful, I continued my downward spiral. In July I came across the Bone Broth Diet book, read it on a Sunday and started on a Monday. I have never had such good and fast results with anything else I've ever tried. I pretty much stick to the 21 day plan all of the time except for when I travel, then I do 80/20. It took 4 months to get 2 lbs from my initial goal weight. This is truly a way of life and not just a "diet.""</em> —Joan</p>
<p>Emotional eating and no willpower to withstand powerful cravings... it can feel like you're stuck on "repeat" with no way out!</p>
<p>One secret of the Bone Broth Diet—the part that really helped Joan break her cycle—is that bone broth helps defeat cravings in a big way. Bone broth is filling, fabulous, and even fun. It truly does satisfy both your psychological cravings and your physical needs. (That’s why I call it liquid gold.) And it’s the biggest secret to a successful mini-fast, where you don't feel even slightly deprived.</p>
<p>Also, another quick note on Joan's face—don't you just love how you can see the difference in her jaw line, in her cheeks, and in the glow from her eyes and skin? Such an awesome transformation!</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“I have struggled with my weight since I was a kid (I'm 45) and I considered myself a professional for losing weight and gaining it back plus a few more. I have done everything...when I was a kid I went the diet center, tried acupuncture, nutrisystem, weight watchers and dozens of books (most not even cracked open) online programs, memberships...you get the picture... </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Then fast forward to July 2016 when I came across your book in my inbox, like the dozens of other, I ordered it. This time was different, the day I got it I sat down after work and read the whole book (and thumbed through the recipes...) </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I was "in" and decided to start the following Monday, August 1st 2016. I had also met a friend/chef who left her job as an executive chef because of a severe auto-immune disease and started making bone broth in an commercial kitchen. This was great because I had a source...no excuse about not having time to make it... </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>I weighed 288 pounds, I was really sick.</strong> This time was different... sick and tired of being sick and tired. It was hard, it was a struggle... oh and did I mention I run a internationally known candy company! (I've been in the candy business all my life). I just used the motto "one day at a time" and sometimes was surviving minute by minute. I did the BBD (2 fasts/week) religiously with a few exceptions until around March when I shifted a bit towards the 80/20 but still do intermittent fasting quite a bit...fast forward to now. <strong>As of this morning I weigh 169 pounds... you can do the math!</strong> I look and feel 10 year younger and have vowed to never go back. You and my BB friend helped save my life! So as it has been said thousands of times... it's my new lifestyle. </em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>”</em> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Patrick </span>  </p>
<p>Patrick mentioned in his email how many different diet systems he has tried over the years. From Nutrisystems to Weight Watchers—these diets have failed him.</p>
<p>Why does the Bone Broth Diet work? It's simple science. With the Bone Broth Diet, you rewire your body to become a natural fat burner. You start by healing your gut, because a leaky gut can literally infect every part of your body and make you unable to lose weight. Then, you load up your body with foods that encourage fat burning and natural collagen production. You cut out the toxins and support your body's natural healthy systems. This is why the Bone Broth Lifestyle will always work better—especially long-term—because instead of just counting calories, you're making all your body's cells work better.</p>]]>

    <title>Brock&apos;s Bone Broth Diet Success Story - Auto-Immune Healing and 90lb Weight Loss</title>
    <author>
      <name>Alex Wittenberg</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Hello everyone! I reached a<strong> huge personal milestone today</strong>, this being the end of an entire year of sticking to the 21-day cleanse and applying it for 365 days with no breaks, no cheats and no compromises. I don’t weigh myself often, but when I did a few weeks ago<strong> I had released over 90 (NINETY!!!!) pounds all from the confinements of bed with ZERO exercise</strong> (I’ll explain in a sec). </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to share my story with the hopes that it might give a boost or that extra nudge to somebody out there who is struggling or who has not yet taken a leap of faith like the one I did a year ago. I haven’t seen many men share their stories, and especially anyone with a similar health circumstance to me, but there’s a first for everything, so here goes nothing (apologies for such a large post)…</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been living since my late teenage years with an auto-immune illness known as M.E. (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis). Unfortunately, I find myself living with a rather severe case of it. As a result I have been housebound and bedridden for the past 8 years. At my worst my illness leaves me unable to speak, open my eyes or move, and lying in a dark, noise restricted room alone in a comatose state with pain virtually across my entire body. At my best I am still extremely ill, but I am able enough to focus on the positive: to smile and to laugh, to write things like this post (albeit at a snail’s pace) and to find ways to try to enjoy life within the small confinements of my room and from my brain foggy mind.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elephant in the room during my journey coping with a chronic illness has been the continued weight gain and water retention. I have gained a lot of weight over these 9 years by eating foods that made me feel good. Surely it was a coping mechanism I chose for losing my previously active and promising life as well as dealing with the loss of most of my friends and family who chose to close the door (some with more blunt force than others). It’s not that I had an unhealthy diet (in fact I was always very conscious of the food I put into my body having been raised by a mother who always took healthy eating habits to heart), but a combination of factors including habitual spouts of nausea and quite picky food choices created an environment where the staple of my diet tended to be centered around white, carb-y “safe” foods. I knew I could do better, but in order to take the easier route out I suppressed any feelings of guilt by rationalizing that, in my situation and with so few things to look forwards to in my day-to-day life, I deserved to indulge in food that I craved as my comfort. To put it simply, I just didn’t want to face the weight. Not today. Not at this time.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">One year ago, I hit my rock bottom. I looked at myself in the mirror and absolutely hated who I saw. I hated how far I had let myself go, and I was scared of what the consequences the direction I was headed in could be. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of self inflicted and irreversible or life threatening damage is a reality for many people who mistreat their bodies, and that terrifies me. None of us are invincible, and eventually bad habits will catch up to us. I didn’t want this for myself. And to be honest, I didn’t want this for my family and friends who did choose to stick around and who have been supporting and caring for me. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coincidentally (or maybe not?), I casually flipped on my TV to see Dr. Kellyann’s seminar on the Bone Broth Diet which was airing on public broadcasting. Normally as soon as I see a sales pitch for a diet, I tune out instantly. After all, over these years it’s not like I hadn’t tried to lose weight or to make what I believed were positive changes. I had gone on soup cleanses, I had cut out sugar for a long period of time, and I had cut out gluten for two years, amongst other things. Sadly, none of these attempts made me feel better physically or mentally, and in fact instead had cast a dark, looming cloud over my mood because I very much missed the foods I couldn’t eat.</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this time, for some reason, I stayed with Kellyann and her information. Her convincing words, and her inspiring and comforting personality gave me the extra nudge of confidence I needed to push me over the edge. I decided right then and there to give her challenge a shot. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did I have to lose ? I had so much to gain, if it worked (I realize the oxymoron in my words…). And I thought to myself that, in the cope of things, three weeks wasn’t so long. I believed I could survive it… and then I thought, “if I could just lose 15 pounds…”</span></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Here I am, one year later, 365 days and 118 fasts later. I have lost close to 100 pounds with no mobility. I’m no longer overweight. </em></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this has happened from the confinements of my bed. It has not been an easy journey. The detox in the first few months was more difficult than I would have imagined. The carb flu I experienced came hard and fast. I had lymph nodes the size of tennis balls and pimples larger than I had ever had before. I experienced very sudden mood swings where I embarrassed myself in front of those closest to me who had the misfortune of being at the brunt of those very brief episodes. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, I pushed through all of those hurdles, and even within the first week on the cleanse I noticed changes. I literally began to drain of fluids starting at the top of my head and working its way down my body on a day-to-day basis. Sure, I had tons of diarrhea, gas and bloating initially, but after a couple of weeks my stomach was beginning to feel so much better and so much flatter. <strong>At the end of the initial 21 days, I had lost 15 pounds.</strong></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I had almost given up to the idea that I could lose weight in my situation. With this incredible change I was so motivated that I decided to continue the cleanse for the the rest of the month. By the month’s end, I had lost even more weight, and I decided to continue indefinitely taking it a month at a time, because how could I ever give up this incredible feeling of healing that I was experiencing?!</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the second month I noticed my cravings for sugar and carbs had VANISHED.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In month four I could feel bones all over my body that I had not felt for years. At the half year mark I could easily fit into clothes that were multiple sizes too small for such a long time. My skin complexion totally transformed, my hair became shinier, and <strong>that “sparkle” in my eyes that had faded finally returned</strong> (at least on my good days). I look so much younger now, and I can feel that my joints and muscles (especially my heart) don’t need to work nearly as hard as they did before. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of positive changes is long and still absolutely floors me. With that in mind, however, I am still very ill and my underlying condition has unfortunately not fundamentally changed, but I am living a much higher quality of life. I have to add that seeing the changes before my eyes and having the knowledge these changes and these new choices were in “my control” continues to keep me determined and disciplined every day to never give into sudden temptations to stop, to cheat or to ease on the brakes. I don’t ever want to go down that pit I put myself in before, and I personally feel that cheating every so often or being lenient would open the flood gates and potentially lead me down a slippery slope, so it's better to go cold turkey.</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know how far this can take me, but <strong>I am excited every day to continue with this lifestyle change I have made.</strong> And I should add that it’s not just the dietary changes I have made that have so deeply impacted my life: it’s the whole package.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I decided when I began this journey that I would simultaneously tackle other poor lifestyle choices I was making. Thus, I adapted the time I took to eat and enjoy my meals to a minimum of 20 minutes (rather than the 7 it could take me to scarf down an entire pizza). I made absolutely sure that I ate on a regular schedule, and that I never went past 7:30PM for dinner. I began daily affirmations and meditation to keep my mind in a healing and positive space. I learned the importance of never going hungry, by drinking warm teas in the morning and in-between meals (I live by my daily morning mug of ginger tea to not only kickstart my digestion but to also help with my nausea). I also learned to keep healthy snacks on hand with me at all times, including mixed nuts (especially pepitas!), coconut chips and beet chips (with no additives, of course!). Finally, I also learned the importance of keeping a well detailed food and fluid journal, and this is something I recommend to all of you. It helped me stay on the path and to keep and hold myself accountable when my sugar-starved mind did everything in its power to trick me and pull me away from my hard work and from my goals. It also helped me visualize and understand (and marvel at) the changes I was making and the changes my body was going through. It’s my belief that it is so much more difficult to succeed long term without this important tool.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am so thankful for Dr. Kellyann’s guidance and motivation and for my closest friends and family who supported and cheered me on. I want to be a cheerleader for anyone here who is currently on their own path or who are on the fence but haven’t yet taken the plunge… The mountain ahead is tall, and you will face many plateaus as I did, but every day that you keep going you will be closer to your goals, and I speak from my experience when I say that the view the farther up you travel is all the more glorious and well worth the climb! If you are still undecided or worried about starting, my advice is to just start. Don't think, just do. The longer you contemplate the more hurdles you will create for yourself.<strong> </strong></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You can do this, you deserve it, you are not a failure and you are not alone!!! </strong></span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Anonymous </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am so proud of this young man. Literally this is the reason that I was put here on this Earth to share this plan. Thank you for writing in to me and allowing me to share this message—and I completely support your decision to keep your name private. Friend, you have completely changed my life and helped me double-down on my motivation with this message. Love, Dr. Kellyann</p>]]>

    <title>Ben&apos;s Success Story - Acid Reflux and Weight Loss</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“Basically I used to work out a bunch, but I drank a lot, and didn't eat much better. The heavy drinking was just the beginning to a suicidal period in my life. When that kicked in I shut down, stayed sedentary, and ate my emotions. I knew part of my recovery would involve my physical health as well, but the battle to live that came first, was much more arduous.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>My friend told me about your diet and that she thought it would help me with a bunch of stomach problems I'd been having, like acid reflux. I had started reading your book and the promises it held, but wasn't sure I was ready to start yet. But then I realized this same friend's birthday was about 3 weeks away, and I decided it was time to start the next day. I wanted to feel like the book said I would by her birthday, and be closer to my old self again.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>In the first 3 weeks I lost 25 lbs and was hooked! I had started at 234 lbs and 38 inch waist, and by her birthday I was 207 lbs, and bought some new 33 inch waist jeans.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I also declared myself over my depression, because I realized I was no longer thinking of the wounds in my past, but instead looking ahead to my future. So when I realized my 37th birthday is going to be about 3 months from my start date, I set the 3 month mark as my 1st cheat day, and 185 (my previous lowest adult weight). </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Well... I hit that goal three and a half weeks early... :p but I've accepted the diet as a lifestyle.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>My cheat day was a good reminder of all the stomach problems that started me eating right. And like my fat, my acid reflux is gone. I stopped taking anything for it day 1 of the diet, and by day 3 my body had righted and my new eating no longer supplied my stomach with all the causes of it's complaints. As I'm about to go back to my routine today, I can't wait to see what the future holds, and still can't believe such amazing results were so easy to get simply by giving my body what it needs.”</em> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Ben</span></p>
<p>Ben's story is so moving to read. Just a quick word on depression—the hormone imbalances that can occur with a sick, leaky gut can impact your mental health, all the way from moodiness and forgetfulness to clinical depression and more. <a href="https://drkellyann.com/blogs/news/the-gut-brain-connection">Your gut is your "second brain"</a> and can control how you feel emotionally. And that's not to mention his amazing weight loss. Ben beat the average weight loss for people who go on the Bone Broth Diet—but not by that much!</p>
<p>The fast, sustainable results from this diet are <em>typical, </em>which is why it has changed so many lives.</p>]]>

    <title>Jen&apos;s Success Story - Adrenal Fatigue Reversed</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“Before I started this plan, I was extremely ill. I had gained over 60 pounds due to meds, thyroid problems and inactivity. I was suffering from uncontrolled Grave's Disease, hyperthyroidism and adrenal fatigue. I was sick and miserable all the time. My doctor recommended this plan and it saved my life.<strong> I went from 214 pounds to 160.</strong> My thyroid levels are stable without meds, all my adrenal symptoms are gone. I feel like my old self again.”</em> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Jen</span></p>
<p>Wow—Jen's before and after pictures are incredible! So many people write me about how much energy they have after they do the Bone Broth Diet. People with thyroid problems have exceptional success on this program.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from a short essay that Tami Meraglia, MD, bestselling author of <em>The Hormone Secret </em>contributed to <a href="https://drkellyann.com/pages/bone-broth-diet"><em>Dr. Kellyann's Bone Broth Diet</em></a>.</p>
<p>“Adrenal fatigue is a general collection of symptoms that affects multiple body systems and can literally hijack your quality of life. Do you feel tired when you wake in the morning and fatigued throughout the day? Do you experience the 3: 00 p.m. crash? Are you grumpy or depressed? Are you gaining weight even though you’re not eating more or exercising less? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions, you may be battling this condition.</p>
<p>Adrenal fatigue drains your hormones, causing deficiencies that can turn your life upside down. Even a mild case stops you from looking and feeling your best. The great news is that adrenal fatigue can be healed by what and when you eat, supplements, and lifestyle changes. An amazing and powerful form of food to heal the adrenal glands is bone broth. There are many aspects of bone broth that are beneficial to health, but the amino acid component is the part that is especially protective against adrenal fatigue.”</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“Dr. Kellyann's diet and bone broth helped both me and my husband. I have Hashimotos and had been unable to lose weight and even though I have been gluten-free for a couple of years I was still not feeling my best.. I've watched a few summits in which Dr. Kellyann spoke and I felt like that was the way I needed to go. It just makes sense!! </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>So after my daughter got married and the stress of planning a wedding was over, my husband and I went for it and started the 21 day bone broth diet. My husband does not have an autoimmune disease, but agreed do it with me. </em></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>In the first week he lost 16lbs and I lost 8. We kept on going for 3 months for a total of 45 lbs lost by my husband and 23lbs by me. Our BMI's are in the healthy range! </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I cooked from the quick start guide and her book and all the food was delicious!! My husband kept saying he couldn't believe he was losing weight and eating so well. We feel better and look better. We are currently in the maintenance phase and love the 80-20 approach!! My endocrinologist told me I needed to slow down on the weight loss and adjusted my thyroid medication! I cut my antibodies in half !! We have since promoted the diet to friends and they have similar results!</em></span><em>”</em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Tracie</span></p>
<p>Wow! Tracie's results are fabulous. <strong>Tracie and her husband lost almost 70lbs, combined</strong>... what a renewed energy this must bring to their household. Doing this diet with a friend or family member allows you to not only get mental and emotional support when you hit a craving or are experiencing the "carb flu" but also lets you share the food and the cooking during your diet.</p>]]>

    <title>Mary&apos;s Success Story - 60lbs Lost—and a Plan to Keep It Off Forever</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“I lost most of my weight in the first 4 months—55 pounds—and 5 more over the next <strong>5 months for 60 pounds total—and have kept it off for more than one year.</strong> I love the eating plan and whenever I start to get out of control I just buckle down and make sure I am doing 80/20 and include 2 fasting days a week. I prefer turkey bone broth but my bones are usually a mixture from bones I've stuck in the freezer. This is the longest I've gone without regaining lost weight. Oh, and I am now 2 years cancer free from colon cancer and truly needed to lose the weight to increase my odds of staying that way. I am currently 64 years old.</em></span><em>”</em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Mary </span></p>
<p>Mary's email proves how <em>truly different</em> the Bone Broth Diet is from other diets. The manageable 21 day cycles with two mini-fasting days each week make this plan a lifelong journey—and YOU get to be the driver. When you learn the three pillars of the Bone Broth Diet... fat-burning foods, collagen and bone broth, plus mini-fasting, you'll have the power to employ these tools for the rest of your life to keep off excess weight forever.</p>
<p>This diet is about so much more than just going from a little frumpy to completely chic. It's about a lifestyle that keeps your cells detoxified and growing in a healthy way.</p>]]>

    <title>Kathie&apos;s Success Story - &quot;The Belly Fat Melted Away&quot;</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“I felt unattractive, frustrated, depressed because other diets never worked. I felt I'd never find a diet that would work. I felt overweight/obese, I had low energy and achey joints. After I saw that my girlfriend had lost and how good she looked, I was determined to try the diet. I bought the book, read it that night and started my transformation. The belly fat melted away, that was my biggest trouble spot. I feel elated I was able to lose and see significant results. <strong>I went from wearing a size 18 down to a 12.</strong> I can't remember when I last wore a 12 so it must have been in junior high school!</em></span><em>”</em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Kathie </span></p>
<p>How would it feel to wear a size that you hadn't worn since JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL? Kathie, I wish I could have been with you the moment you pulled those pants. I love that you and your friend were able to take this journey together and you were able to reverse the achey joints, and feelings of unattractiveness.</p>
<p>The change in Kathie's belly fat is obvious, but even though the lighting is different in the before and after picture, you can really see how her face looks firmer and less puffy as well. This is a clear sign of improved gut health! Radiant from the inside out.</p>]]>

    <title>Jamie&apos;s Success Story - Healing Chronic Colitis</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I've lost 12lbs in the 21 days. I had the carb flu the entire 21 days but I am starting to feel great and refreshed. I suffer from chronic colitis and from day 1 I have not had my usual pain and bloating. I could tell instantly that real food and clean eating produce extreme benefits. Healing my body is my number one goal, but all of this weight loss is a great perk as well!" </span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—Jamie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>One of the amazing things about adding bone broth into your diet—no matter if you're trying to heal your body, like Jamie, or trying to lose twenty pounds or more—it helps to heal your gut from the very first sip. So many people who try the Bone Broth Diet to lose weight also have digestive problems— constipation, diarrhea, gas, or even all three. Jamie had chronic colitis, which is an inflammation of the inner lining of the colon—and it can be very dangerous.  Weight gain and digestive problems often stem from a common source: a sick gut. The gelatin and other nutrients in bone broth help heal the gut, curing digestive problems while they facilitate weight loss.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><em>"The pic on the left is March 20th of this year at the birth of my 6th grandchild. I actually gained about 5 more pounds from that pic by the time I started the diet in mid June. I'm so glad my son had this pic because I didn't take a before pic. I was shocked when he sent me the pic this week. It looks like more than 34lbs... "</em> —Lorie</p>
<p>Those important moments in our lives, like when a new baby comes, can be such markers—we can see how far we've come and how far we have left to go. Lorie has continued to lose weight and be an active part of the Bone Broth Diet Community in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bonebrothdietrevolution">private Facebook Group.</a> Often people do multiple "rounds" of the 21-day Bone Broth Diet (including Lorie).</p>
<p>After the initial weight loss and improved health after their first 21-day cycle, people often spend a week or two on the <a href="https://drkellyann.com/products/digital-book-80-20">Bone Broth Diet 80/20 plan</a>, and then cycle back into the detoxifying 21 days when they are ready or when they feel like they may be regaining a little bit of weight. Now that <a href="https://drkellyann.com/pages/10-day-belly-slimdown">The 10-Day Belly Slimdown</a> is available, members of the group are excited to work the longer fasting windows into their rotations.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure... Lorie certainly does not look like a grandmother of six in the second picture, does she? With so much weight lost, she looks she just graduated college! Amazing!</p>]]>

    <title>Keri&apos;s Success Story - Beating Symptoms of Lofgren&apos;s Syndrome</title>
    <author>
      <name>Alex Wittenberg</name>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><em>"Well, it's time to celebrate. <strong>I've reached by goal weight, having lost 25 pounds and almost three full clothing sizes.</strong> More importantly, I've got ME back - the real me.</em></p>
<p><em>By the beginning of March, 2017, I had sunk into depression. Three years ago, I was diagnosed with Lofgren's Syndrome, a form of sarcoidosis, an auto-immune disease that triggers arthritic inflammation in the extremity joints. Although I had officially been in remission for a year, the pain, inflammation and weight gain that came with the steroids required to treat the condition haunted me. Coupled with chronic lower back pain, I was spiraling into a vicious circle where food was my solace, but also my tormentor. I was terrified that if I didn't motivate myself to change my lifestyle that the disease would return or would be replaced with something much worse.</em></p>
<p><em>A friend of mine told me about the benefits of bone broth and linked me to Dr. Kellyann's book. I bought it immediately, made tons of broth, threw out all the processed food in my house, and began the 21 day program right after Easter. I was super strict when I didn't think I had the willpower to be - no wheat, dairy or sugar - which I knew were all horrible culprits. After the first week, I could FEEL my body reacting - pushing away the inflammation. I reclaimed my control over food demons, and reclaimed my body. <strong>I could look in the mirror and feel good about myself again.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>After my first two 21 day rounds, people around me noticed, telling me I looked "healthy," asking "what have you been doing?" And the energy! </em></p>
<p><em>As a teacher, I could finally work on assignments and mark papers without joint pain. I could sit and do my work instead of having to stand and take tons of breaks because of swollen ankles, knees, fingers and wrists. I consigned all my clothes this past weekend, and have treated myself to new ones, in new styles that make me feel confident and yes, even a bit sexy (and at my age... 48). The best part of this journey was getting family pictures taken, looking at the proofs and seeing ME - the real me - not the swollen, sore, sad and sickly person from the past.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much Dr. Kellyann. I'm officially 80/20 and there is NO turning back!</em>" -Keri</p>]]>
